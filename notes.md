help me explain how this css code make a rotated triangle line by line “/* balloon::after is the arrow, which is rotated 45 degrees */
.balloon::after {
  content: ''; /* content is required for pseudo elements */
  position: absolute; /* position the arrow relative to the balloon */
  border: 6px solid transparent; /* make the arrow transparent */
  border-bottom: 8px solid #555; /* make the arrow black */
  width: 0;
  height: 0;
  top: 40px;
  left: 40px;
  transform: rotate(-45deg); /* rotate the arrow */
}”
```

Sure, I can help you explain how this CSS code creates a rotated triangle step by step:

1. The first line creates a pseudo-element that is attached to the end of the .balloon element. The ::after pseudo-element is used to style the triangle that will serve as the arrow.

```
.balloon::after {
  content: '';
```

2. The second line sets the position of the arrow as absolute, which means that it will be positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor element. In this case, it will be positioned relative to the .balloon element.

```
position: absolute;
```

3. The next line sets the border of the arrow to be transparent, except for the bottom border which is set to 8 pixels wide and black (#555). This creates the triangle shape of the arrow.

```
border: 6px solid transparent;
border-bottom: 8px solid #555;
```

4. The next two lines set the width and height of the arrow to 0. This is necessary because we are using the border property to create the triangle shape, so we don't need any actual content inside the pseudo-element.

```
width: 0;
height: 0;
```

5. The next two lines set the position of the arrow from the top and left of the .balloon element.

```
top: 40px;
left: 40px;
```

6. Finally, the transform property is used to rotate the arrow 45 degrees counterclockwise. This creates the angled arrow shape.

```
transform: rotate(-45deg);
```

So, altogether, this CSS code creates a black arrow that is positioned at the top right corner of the .balloon element, and is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise.

help me explain how this css code make a rotated triangle line by line “/* balloon::after is the arrow, which is rotated 45 degrees */
.balloon::after {
  content: ''; /* content is required for pseudo elements */
  position: absolute; /* position the arrow relative to the balloon */
  border: 6px solid transparent; /* make the arrow transparent */
  border-bottom: 8px solid #555; /* make the arrow black */
  width: 0;
  height: 0;
  top: 40px;
  left: 40px;
  transform: rotate(-45deg); /* rotate the arrow */
}”
```

Sure, I can help you explain how this CSS code creates a rotated triangle step by step:

1. The first line creates a pseudo-element that is attached to the end of the .balloon element. The ::after pseudo-element is used to style the triangle that will serve as the arrow.

```
.balloon::after {
  content: '';
```

2. The second line sets the position of the arrow as absolute, which means that it will be positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor element. In this case, it will be positioned relative to the .balloon element.

```
position: absolute;
```

3. The next line sets the border of the arrow to be transparent, except for the bottom border which is set to 8 pixels wide and black (#555). This creates the triangle shape of the arrow.

```
border: 6px solid transparent;
border-bottom: 8px solid #555;
```

4. The next two lines set the width and height of the arrow to 0. This is necessary because we are using the border property to create the triangle shape, so we don't need any actual content inside the pseudo-element.

```
width: 0;
height: 0;
```

5. The next two lines set the position of the arrow from the top and left of the .balloon element.

```
top: 40px;
left: 40px;
```

6. Finally, the transform property is used to rotate the arrow 45 degrees counterclockwise. This creates the angled arrow shape.

```
transform: rotate(-45deg);
```

So, altogether, this CSS code creates a black arrow that is positioned at the top right corner of the .balloon element, and is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise.

Certainly! Here is an explanation of how this code can lift the balloon element on the page up and form an animation:

1. The `lifting` function is defined. This function is responsible for lifting up the balloons.

```
function lifting() {
```

2. The first line inside the function hides the `gameCanvas` element by setting its `display` property to `none`. This is done so that the balloons are the only visible elements during the animation.

```
gameCanvas.style.display = 'none'
```

3. The next line starts a `for` loop that iterates through each balloon in the `balloons` array.

```
for (const balloon of balloons) {
```

4. Inside the loop, the `lift` method is called on each balloon object. The `lift` method is likely a custom method that is defined elsewhere in the codebase, and is responsible for changing the position of the balloon on the page to simulate it lifting up.

```
balloon.lift()
```

5. After the loop completes, the `gameCanvas` element is shown again by setting its `display` property to `block`.

```
gameCanvas.style.display = 'block'
```

6. Finally, `requestAnimationFrame` is used to schedule the next iteration of the `lifting` function. This is necessary to create a smooth animation, as it schedules the next frame to be drawn right before the browser's next repaint cycle. This ensures all changes to the DOM are made before the next frame is drawn.

```
requestAnimationFrame(lifting)
```

7. Finally, the `lifting` function is called once to start the animation.

```
lifting() // start lifting balloons up
```

So, altogether, this code uses the `lifting` function to iterate through each balloon in an array, and call a custom `lift` method on each balloon to simulate it lifting up. The `requestAnimationFrame` method is used to schedule the next iteration of the `lifting` function, creating a smooth animation effect. Additionally, the `gameCanvas` element is hidden and shown again to ensure that only the balloons are visible during the animation.
